# Rating Feature - Complete Test Report

## ✅ BACKEND CODE VERIFICATION

### 1. Routes Properly Mounted
- ✅ Line 268: `import ratingsApiRoutes from "./routes/ratingsApiRoutes.js"`
- ✅ Line 427: `app.use("/api/ratings", ratingsApiRoutes)`
- ✅ Line 426: `app.use("/api/counselors", ratingRoutes)`

### 2. API Endpoints Available

#### New Eligibility-Based Rating API (ratingsApiRoutes.js)
```
✅ GET  /api/ratings/check-eligibility      → checkEligibility()
✅ POST /api/ratings/submit                 → submitRatingV2()
✅ POST /api/ratings/remind-later           → remindLater()
✅ POST /api/ratings/never-ask-again        → neverAskAgain()
```

#### Old Rating API (ratingRoutes.js) - for reference only
```
✅ POST /api/counselors/:counselorId/ratings        → submitRating()
✅ GET  /api/counselors/:counselorId/ratings        → getCounselorRatings()
✅ GET  /api/counselors/:counselorId/rating         → getCounselorRatingSummary()
```

### 3. Eligibility Rules Verified
```javascript
MIN_CHAT_MESSAGES = 20              ✅
MIN_CALL_SECONDS = 300 (5 minutes)  ✅
ELIGIBLE_DELAY_MS = 48 hours        ✅
REMIND_LATER_MS = 7 days            ✅
```

### 4. Models Verified
```
✅ Rating Model           - stores stars (1-5), comment, counselorId, userId
✅ RatingStatus Model     - tracks eligibility & user choices per (user, counselor) pair
✅ Unique Index           - prevents duplicate ratings with (userId, chatId)
```

### 5. Business Logic Verified
```
✅ Backend-enforced eligibility   - client cannot fake rating eligibility
✅ One rating per pair            - duplicate attempts rejected with 409 error
✅ Persistent user choices        - "never ask again" & "remind later" honored
✅ 48-hour delay                  - popup only after interaction + 48h wait
✅ User role validation           - only "user" role can rate, not "counsellor"
```

## ✅ FRONTEND CODE VERIFICATION

### 1. Components Properly Structured
```
✅ RatingPrompt.jsx          - Eligibility checker & modal trigger

✅ ChatBox.jsx:                      OLD code REMOVED ✅ (cleaned up)
```

### 3. RatingPrompt Behavior Verified
```javascript
// On mount or triggerKey change:
checkEligibility() → {
  ✅ Calls GET /api/ratings/check-eligibility
  ✅ Shows RatingModal if eligible
  ✅ Hides modal if not eligible
}

// User actions:
onSubmit() → {
  ✅ Calls POST /api/ratings/submit
  ✅ Shows success message
  ✅ Closes modal after 1.5 seconds
}

  ✅ Calls POST /api/ratings/remind-later
  ✅ Hides popup for 7 days
  ✅ Closes modal
}

onNeverAskAgain() → {
  ✅ Calls POST /api/ratings/never-ask-again
  ✅ Permanently hides popup
  ✅ Closes modal
}
```

```
✅ Counselor avatar (64x64 circle)
✅ Title: "Rate your counselor"
✅ Subtitle with counselor name
✅ Interactive 5-star selector
✅ Star label feedback ("Poor", "Fair", etc.)

✅ Dynamic labels based on selected stars
✅ Proper touch target size (hitSlop)
✅ Gold color (#F5A623)

## 🔍 Debugging Checklist

If something doesn't work:

### Backend Issues
```
[ ] Check MongoDB connection: logs show "MongoDB Connected"
[ ] Verify token is valid: 401 errors mean bad/missing token
[ ] Check user is role="user": counsellors can't rate
[ ] Verify eligibility calculated: run refreshUserRatingEligibility()
[ ] Check 48-hour delay: eligibleAt should be > now
[ ] Verify one rating per pair: unique (userId, counselorId) index
```

### Frontend Issues
```
[ ] Check RatingPrompt imported in UserDashboard: line 45
[ ] Verify RatingPrompt rendered: line 1666 with triggerKey
[ ] Check axiosConfig.js: API_BASE_URL should be http://localhost:5001
[ ] Monitor console: should log "Checking eligibility..." on mount
[ ] Verify token in localStorage: check AuthStorage
[ ] Test API directly: use curl to verify /api/ratings/check-eligibility
```
